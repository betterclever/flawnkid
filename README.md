# FLAWNKID
A kid-centric launcher that focuses on putting parental control on apps and time spent on apps by their kids while gamifying
the whole process to make it rewarding for kids as well.

## Motivation
In the current society, almost every child, owns a mobile phone. The cureent scenario comprises of parents worried about the type of content their child is engrossed with. Seeing this problem, we tried to develop a product which will help the parents keep track of the content in the child's phone, and simultaneously gamifying the whole process so that the child is also comfortable with the product. We have also tried to involve the community game developers, and provide them with substansial benefits based on a bounty based smart contract system, depending on the user interest with their product.

## Features
* A simple 3- page Android Launcher screen, which features a customized dashboard for the users, which contains live educational feeds from various educational areas such as national geographic. It features a simple UI containing all the apps installed by the user. The launcher also contains different educational games of different genres, developed using **three.js**.
* The user gains points, called *'Pojos'* when he plays the games, The quantity of the *Pojos* depends on the progress of the user in the game. The *pojos* are spent when the user uses some app, where the rate of depreceation depends on the type of application being used. 
* When the *pojos* expires while using the app, the app is closed automatically, and user has to play games to earn more *Pojos*.
* The game developers have the option to uplaod their games according to the interests of the parents. The game developers are awarded in the form of **ethereum coins**, depending on the user interaction and usability. In this way, the community also gets involved with the product.
* There is an admin panel for the parents, which shows the interesest of their child by analysing the type of apps and the games in which he spends his most time on. In this way, the parents can analyse the interest of the child.
